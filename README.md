# Responsive Portfolio

A responsive, technical portfolio showcasing the projects I've built as a SheCodes Student.
## Features

- Custom, responsive navbar
- Used media queries & Bootstrap to create responsive layout 


## Lessons Learned


- I learned that Bootstrap is an incredibly useful framework for creating responsive layouts.
- I learned I can replicate a professional design given to me on Figma and make it "pixel-perfect."
- I gained confidence in sharing my work with others, knowing it would look good on any device viewed on. With phones now being the primary viewport, I felt like the possibilies are endless now that I have this skill.
